On most major platforms, the emoji depicts the transgender flag, composed of blue, pink, and white stripes, waving in the wind. The Twitter version of the emoji resembles the flag in the form of a rectangle with rounded corners. As of March 2021, the Transgender Flag emoji 🏳️‍⚧️ is not yet supported on Microsoft devices and will instead appear as a box followed by the Transgender Symbol emoji ⚧️.  Before it was eventually approved in 2020, people had been campaigning for  a transgender flag emoji for years. As early as 2016, Google creative director Tea Uglow had submitted a proposal for a transgender flag emoji to the Unicode Consortium. The proposal was denied. For the next several years, activists would launch campaigns to drive support for a transgender flag emoji. These campaigns would gather widespread support and would eventually lead to a Unicode proposal for a transgender flag emoji submitted in 2019 that was backed by representatives from Google and Microsoft.    Prior to the addition of the Transgender Flag emoji 🏳️‍⚧️, transgender activists began to use the Lobster emoji 🦞 in 2018 to represent transgender pride and support for a transgender flag emoji. This usage of the Lobster emoji 🦞 was due to the activism of the group Lobsters Against Transphobia.  In a petition directed toward the Unicode Consortium, the group explained that they chose the lobster to express outrage of Unicode seemingly prioritizing crustaceans over transgender people in their decisions of which emoji to approve: “Unicode granted the Lobster emoji proposal, which argued that people suffered ‘frustration and confusion’ at having to use a shrimp or crab emoji instead of a lobster. Imagine if that was your gender. Surely we deserve the same rights you have afforded crustaceans?” The group ended the petition with “Lobsters can actually be gynandromorphs (an organism that contains both male and female characteristics). So we’re going to take it as our symbol, until we get the Trans emoji we deserve.”"
🍔 Hamburger emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/hamburger-emoji/,"The Hamburger emoji 🍔 depicts a typical cheeseburger on sesame buns with lettuce and tomato. This emoji is popularly used in various content dealing, of course, with eating different types of hamburgers, especially on National Hamburger Day on May 28.

The beef patty (usually pan fried or cooked on a grill and then topped with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and condiments like mayonnaise or ketchup) is believed to ultimately come from Hamburg, Germany. First, in 1758, the “Hamburgh sausage” appeared, a sausage served on warm bread, and later, in the mid-1800s, roasted beefsteak appeared on a warm bread roll. The first American version of a hamburger may have been served by Louis Lassen of Louis’ Lunch in 1900 in New Haven, Connecticut. There are a few other claims that put the burger on American plates slightly earlier than 1900. The first hamburger chain restaurant? White Castle. And the first McDonald’s location opened in California, way back in 1940. The Hamburger emoji 🍔 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010. Despite the emoji’s official name, most major platforms depict a classic cheeseburger on sesame buns with lettuce and tomato. The layering of those toppings has been subject to some popular controversy. An early Google version once had the cheese underneath the patty; it was corrected after the internet chastised Google for getting it wrong. Apple and WhatsApp place the lettuce under the patty."

Now for a bit of history: Legend has it that, in the fifth century, St. Patrick used the three-leafed shamrock to explain the Christian concept of the trinity (God the father, son, and Holy Spirit, all in one) on his mission in Ireland, where the plant plentifully grows. By the 1600s, the story inspired the use of the shamrock as an emblem for St. Patrick, and, because the saint became so closely identified with the country, a symbol for Ireland as a whole."

Her default form has an ethnically neutral yellow face, though users can select different skin tones to change the color of her face and hair for their desired representation. Don’t confuse her with the Girl emoji, which looks like the Woman emoji 👩 but with the hair pulled into pigtails: 👧.

In the mid-1700s, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus—the guy who gave us all those Latin names in science, or binomial nomenclature—had the idea to use this ancient symbol to mark the female sex in plant genetics. That convention spread to medicine and other fields, notably adopted by feminists in the 1970s. The Female Sign emoji ♀ was approved by Unicode in 1993, becoming widespread under Unicode 6.0 in 2010.

Ages later, one of those lilies was said to be gifted by the Virgin Mary to Clovis, king of the Franks, upon his baptism. This made the lily both a symbol of French royalty and a symbol of the French crown’s link to the Roman Catholic church (i.e., the divine right to govern). It helps that the lily also looks sort of like a cross and has three petals, evoking the Christian concept of Holy Trinity. The symbol continued to be used throughout French history, well into the country’s colonial phase. Today it can still be seen in use by several former French colonial areas. And here’s your quick French language lesson for the day. Fleur-de-lis literally translates to “flower of the lily.” And the lily, while botanically distinct from the iris, has been historically used as a term for the fleur-de-lis, especially as the symbol of France. The fleur-de-lis was widespread and culturally significant enough that it was proposed to the Unicode Consortium in 2003. In 2005, the symbol was included as part of Unicode’s 4.1 release, where it was classified under “Miscellaneous Symbols.” In 2015, it was also part of their Emoji 1.0 set alongside other symbols like Check Mark Button ✅, Japanese Symbol for Beginner 🔰, and Recycling Symbol ♻️ emoji.

💛 Yellow Heart emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/yellow-heart-emoji/,"The yellow heart emoji, 💛, can convey love, just like any other heart symbol or emoji, but its yellow color often gets used to show liking and friendship (as opposed to romantic love). Its color also works with expressions of happiness—and with all things yellow, from sports team colors to dresses.","The yellow heart emoji 💛, along with the other rainbow of heart emoji, was approved under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. Across platforms, its yellow shines with a golden hue. The color yellow can symbolize happiness, positivity, and hope (think sunshine), which helps explain why this emoji, while still used for love, may skew toward feelings of friendship and joy as opposed to the romantic passion of a classic red heart. The social app Snapchat recognized the symbolism of the color yellow in 2015 when it introduced the yellow heart emoji 💛 to represent two users who are “#1 Best Friends”—the person who you send the most messages (snaps) to and receive the most snaps from."

The face screaming in fear emoji, 😱, depicts a face with wide, usually blank eyes, and a mouth open in a scream.

💞 Revolving Hearts emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/revolving-hearts-emoji/,"You spin us right round, emoji, right round …  The revolving hearts emoji, 💞, depicts two tiny hearts orbiting each other (or spinning in a circle).

Most platforms depict a smaller red or pink heart in the upper right next to a larger one in the lower left, with similarly colored ribbons representing that they are rotating, as shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below.

Most versions of the emoji, as shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below, display a heart growing by at least two sizes, with the color of the hearts lightening at each higher level. Older versions actually animated a heart to grow larger. The design of growing heart emoji 💗 reminds us of one notable instance from Dr. Suess’s 1957 children’s book (and 1966 animated film) How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Early on in the story, it’s implied that the main reason for the fictional Grinch’s misanthropy is that his heart is “two sizes too small.” At the story’s climax, the Grinch has an epiphany about humanity (and Christmas) that causes his shriveled heart to “[grow] three sizes that day.” "
⛄️ Snowman Without Snow emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/snowman-without-snow-emoji/,"The negative squared Latin capital letter B emoji, 🅱️, (that’s a mouthful) has come a long away from its intended meaning. It began as a way to represent the blood type B, evolved into a way to signal the Bloods online, and was finally appropriated by internet culture for absurdist or racist memes. Some people use it more innocuously just as a creative stand in for the letter B in texts or on social media.","The Unicode Standard officially calls 🅱️ the negative squared Latin capital letter B emoji, but it’s commonly referred to as the B button emoji, a much more convenient name … because seriously that’s a long name. B button emoji was approved under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. Across platforms, it appears as a white, capital letter B on a red square. It was originally intended to represent the blood type B alongside A (🅰️), AB (🆎), and O (🅾️) because you totally need to represent your blood type in emoji form all the time, right? Want to know a blood type fun fact? In East Asian countries like Japan, there is a popular belief that a person’s blood type influences their personality, character, and compatibility with others. People there took to the B button emoji to communicate their blood type on social media, especially in dating and romantic contexts. Aha. In the US, the B button emoji went down a completely different path. The Los Angeles-based street gang, the Bloods, have been known to change words with the letter C, the first letter of their rival gang the Crips, to Bs (e.g., boolin‘ (cooling) and Bompton (Compton)).  The B button became especially popular, and controversial, on the internet after YouTuber Swolotag trolled Hillary “🅱️linton” in a widely viewed video in October 2016 called “Spell Icup Ni 🅱️🅱️a.” Here, the B button emoji replaced the Gs in nigga, with nibba. The video plays on stereotypes of black people and feminists and seems deliberately designed to “trigger” so-called libtards.  Into the late 2010s, the use of the B button emoji quickly became associated with problematic and sometimes deliberately racist memes on social media like Reddit and Instagram known as “deep fried” memes. As all memes do, the B button emoji also inspired spinoffs, such as the P button emoji, 🅿️. A popular deep fried meme character is Peter Griffin, from the cartoon Family Guy, referred to as Beter in the meme. After dozens of iterations of Beter Griffin, meme makers struck back against the lazy overuse of the B button with their own Peter Griffin emoji—featuring the P button emoji instead."
🅱️ B Button emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/b-button-emoji/,"The Snowman Without Snow emoji ⛄ depicts a snowman, which is a person-like figure made of snow. This emoji has no snow falling on or around, unlike the Snowman emoji ☃️, which does.  The Snowman Without Snow emoji ⛄ is used to mark content dealing with snow, winter, winter holidays, the cold, Disney’s Frozen, and, of course, actual snowpeople.","Unicode approved the Snowman Without Snow emoji ⛄ in 2009 under Unicode 5.2. In August 2015, it was also added to its Emoji 1.0 set.  The Snowman emoji ☃️, which features falling snowflakes, existed before Snowman Without Snow emoji ⛄ did … as a Unicode glyph in 1993 and originally didn’t feature snow. Go figure. The Snowman Without Snow emoji ⛄ is used interchangeably with the Snowman emoji ☃️. Discerning emoji fans may opt for the Snowman emoji ☃️ for extra wintry effect. Most versions of the Snowman Without Snow emoji ⛄ have only two mounds (a head and a body). The snowman usually sports a top hat, carrot nose, stick arms, and often a scarf … Frosty the Snowman style. Why only two mounds, you ask? The West is more used to seeing three-mound snowmen, but there may be a reason why Japanese ones only have two. The Japanese word for snowman is yukidaruma, which literally translates as “snow daruma.” A daruma is a type of little, round, wooden, or papier mâché doll, closely linked to Buddhist practice and often used as a token of good luck. Legend has it that the doll represents a Buddhist monk called Bodhidharma, who meditated for nine years sitting down, atrophying his legs—which is why the doll is round. OK, why are we telling you this story? Early to medieval Japanese woodblock paintings have depicted two-mound snow sculptures resembling daruma, which suggests a link between Japanese two-mounded snowmen to the legend of Bodhidharma."
💀 Skull emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/skull-emoji/,"The Skull emoji 💀 shows a simple skull, not to be confused with the Skull and Crossbones ☠️ emoji … that one is completely different, of course. The black cavities of the Skull emoji 💀, where the eyes would be, are enormous, and the inclusion of teeth varies from platform to platform. It’s mostly used in lighthearted posts related to death or scary things.","The Skull emoji 💀 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. The difference between the Skull emoji 💀 and the Skull and Crossbones ☠️ emoji is the tone, mainly. The Skull and Crossbones ☠️ emoji conveys poison and death, quite literally: it’s often the symbol to indicate poison on a product. Meanwhile, the Skull emoji 💀 has a more fun feel … even though it still can be used when talking about death. The human skull has long been associated with death and creepy things. Being an easily identified part of a skeleton, it’s the part of the body that conveys the deepest representational meaning of life, both past and present. During the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) holiday traditions, in which late loved ones are remembered, the skull is an omnipresent symbol, represented in sugary treats and colorful art. While looking death right in the face (or what’s left of it) should be scary, the bejeweled, bedazzled, kaleidoscopic Day of the Dead treatment of the human skull has a way of turning fear into something much easier to manage. Overall, while we associate it with death, the skull has also enjoyed popularity in trendy design, being featured on everything from jewelry to clothing."

Pretzels go back to European monasteries of the Middle Ages, when dough was rolled out and twisted into bite-size knots. The pretzel emoji 🥨 looks a lot like the kind of mass-produced pretzels you buy in bags at the grocery store, and while those certainly satisfy cravings for something crunchy and salty … a pillowy, fresh-baked pretzel is another animal. Over the years, in an attempt to gourmet-up the modest treat, pretzels have taken on all kinds of flavoring partners, from cheese to chocolate, spices to sweet glazes. And don’t forget all the pretzel dips. Swoon. Why did it take so long to get a pretzel emoji 🥨 ? It only came about in 2017, as part of Unicode 10.0 and Emoji 5.0, well after the bread 🍞, pizza 🍕, and hot dog 🌭 emoji appeared. What gives?

It’s used in posts about food (specifically breakfast), France, and bread … lots of bread.","If you’ve just finally mastered the correct pronunciation of croissant, we’ve got one more word that will really make you sound fancy. A croissant is a Viennoiserie pastry, with Viennoiserie meaning “things of Vienna.” It’s not a French invention, as many think, but was born in Vienna, Austria, with its ancestor, the simple kipferi roll, going back to the 13th century. The croissant is, however, a staple of the French breakfast.

The lizard emoji is green though … and it’s also a quadrupedal lizard (meaning it has four legs) because a “legless lizard” (that’s a thing) would be confusing, and look a lot like a snake. A legless lizard is not a snake. It’s a legless lizard, with eyelids, openings for ears, and notched rather than forked tongues. Now you know a lot about lizards … The lizard emoji was approved as part of Unicode 9.0 in 2016 and added to Emoji 3.0 in 2016."

The parrot is always sitting, or perched, facing to the left, but it appears variously in deep reds, emerald greens, and teal blues, accented with metallic golds or sunny yellow.

An especially annoyed Apple user posted this on an Apple forum, mistakenly assuming that the creation of emoji was up to Apple: “We need parrot emojis. You guys took our gun so it’s the least you could do. All I want it to be able to put a parrot emoji at the end of a text when I talk about my favorite pet.” After that angry rant … the parrot emoji was approved as part of Unicode 11.0 in 2018 and added to Emoji 11.0 in 2018.

🦜 Parrot emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/parrot-emoji/,"A symbol of springtime, the lovely tulip is represented in the emoji world by tulips in various shades of pink and red, with almost every digital platform showing a stem and two long leaves reaching skyward.

Used in social media wherever beauty, romance, flowers, and gardening themes are prevalent, the Tulip emoji 🌷 also appears in texting on occasion to represent female genitalia due its soft, pink petals. Why? Flowers have long been viewed as being appropriately representative of this part of a woman’s anatomy. The most famous instance is in the work of painter Georgia O’Keeffe, though many critics now dismiss the Freudian theory that O’Keeffe’s flower paintings were intentionally created with vulvas in mind. She always claimed they were not, and the initial theory was put forth by a man, the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who became her husband … so there’s that. Tulips come in a dazzling array of colors and are beloved for their beautiful symmetry, grace, and ease in growing. Just throw some bulbs in the ground in the fall, and you’re likely to get some tulips in spring! Sadly, the blooms only last for a few days. Tulips are part of the lily family, and all of their colors symbolize things as well: red symbolizes true love, white symbolizes purity and forgiveness, and yellow is all about good wishes, sunshine, and cheeriness. Pink? Pink is about affection, but it’s not as strong an expression of love as red. Tulips are native to central Asia, but migrated to the Netherlands, or Holland, where they became a treasured, precious item during “Tulip mania” in the Dutch Golden Age of the 1600s. The bulbs and flowers were so fashionable and so desired that the exceedingly high prices created what is often referred to as the first “speculative bubble” in an economic market. The Netherlands is the world’s largest tulip producer today."
🌷 Tulip emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/tulip-emoji/,"Gobble, gobble! The turkey emoji represents the … well … turkey and serves as a symbol for the American holiday of Thanksgiving. It also can signify non-holiday related feelings of gratitude.","School kids in America are often taught that turkey on Thanksgiving is an American tradition because it’s what the pilgrims shared with the Native Americans to thank them for helping them survive the winter. In truth, the alleged three-day feast shared by the settlers and Wampanoag in 1621 probably featured venison … but that’s a different story. Back to why Americans eat turkey on Thanksgiving … the holiday of Thanksgiving began in 1863 as an effort to unify the country in the throes of the Civil War. Turkey was promoted as a food in order to Americanize immigrants and for practical purposes: one of these beasts can feed a lot of people. Fast forward to 2015 when the turkey emoji entered Unicode as a symbol for the Thanksgiving holiday. It shows a large brown bird, facing left with a red neck, and waddle. It’s in the “animals and nature” sections of emojis since it depicts a live bird, one that could be happily running around in the wild. While there is a chicken drumstick and other food versions of the chicken in Unicode, there is not emoji of a dressed turkey ready for the oven. In 2017, the poultry company Butterball launched a Change.org petition for a dead and plucked version of the bird to be added to emoji language. Poor turkey.

Medieval masons and builders often marked stones and columns with strawberry designs to symbolize perfection and righteousness.

And so the berry—even before we figured out the magic of dipping them in chocolate—came to symbolize love and romance.

Insomniac Magazine calls it “blushing smiley face’s ratchet stepsister” and instructs you, upon receiving one, to “apologize immediately, ideally with actual words.” On Hello Giggles, Madison Vanderberg suggests using it if you receive an unwanted nude, “If you’re polite, you hit them with this emoji.”  That’s because this yellow face stares directly ahead with red-tinged cheeks. On Google devices the blush is downplayed in favor of a sense of shock, and Microsoft’s perfectly round red circles look almost like tears. It’s the perfect way to express a truly cringey feeling. "

Where the use of this emoji at one time might have more serious intent or connotations, now it’s mostly used in more playful ways, though it can also pertain to gun culture (pro and con).","The original pistol emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Original versions appeared on various platforms as a strong representation of a firearm or weapon. In 2016, Apple swapped out their version to a bright green plastic-looking toy gun, and other platforms soon followed suit. Google and Microsoft even added a round water chamber on top of their colorful image, making it appear very much like a water gun. There are a few platforms, like LG and Mozilla, that still show realistic gun images, but those are being phased out."
🤟 I Love You Gesture emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/love-you-gesture-emoji/,"A universal emoji! Or … is it? The love-you gesture or I love you hand sign emoji is the American Sign Language gesture for “I love you,” showing a hand with a raised index finger and pinky (little) finger and an extended thumb. It comes in a range of skin tones. It’s used to express affection … but is also used when people are trying to find the sign of the horns 🤘instead (oops).","It seems a natural fit for the Unicode consortium (emoji gatekeepers, for the most part) to embrace American Sign Language signals. The love-you gesture or I love you hand sign emoji was approved for Unicode 10.0 in 2017 and added to Emoji 5.0 in 2017. It came about after a petition by two people, one being Western Oregon University professor C.M. Hall. In 2015, Hall said, “The deaf community being one that is incredibly marginalized and pathologized … When we insert gestures (in emoji), we are already communicating visually, so why not include the most recognized gesture in ASL? I see it as such a simple, yet profound benchmark of dignity.” Perhaps, surprisingly to some, the love-you gesture emoji is commonly used in reference to rock music, due to its similarity to its rock’n’roll cousin, the sign of the horns or rock on emoji. The love-you emoji shows the thumb extended, as it is in American Sign Language, while the sign of the horns emoji depicts the thumb tucked into the hand. They’re so similar that the rock star Gene Simmons of the band KISS attempted to trademark this version, the love-you gesture emoji, as his own take on the rock on emoji. He withdrew his application, mostly due to widespread criticism from other musicians.  Maybe he also withdrew it when he realized it was the wrong symbol …"
🌰 Chestnut emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/chestnut-emoji/,"The Chestnut emoji 🌰 is sometimes referred to as the Raisin emoji because it is so often mistaken for one—especially on small screens and on digital platforms where the nut is very dark brown. The acorn-shaped brown nut is similar across all platforms where it sometimes slightly resembles a Hershey’s chocolate kiss. It’s mostly used in reference to winter and fall and to those wily squirrels running amok in the yard. Oh, and it also represents some other nuts … the human variety.","Since there is no walnut or pecan emoji, the Chestnut emoji 🌰 gets around in all postings related to nuts (you know what that means). Actually, we should clarify: it is the only tree nut emoji. A peanut emoji does exist, but it’s a different kind of nut that grows underground. Chestnuts, by the way, must be cooked to be eaten. The Chestnut emoji 🌰 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. The Apple version is the only one that sits at slight tilt. The Chestnut emoji 🌰 is sometimes mistaken for a raisin."
🌯 Burrito emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/burrito-emoji/,"Mmmmmm. The burrito emoji depicts a rolled up tortilla, with different platforms showing ingredients like beans and cheese poking out. (You can even discern the cilantro in Apple’s version, which looks darn delicious.) In many versions, it’s wrapped in foil–”Mission” style, named for the Mission District of San Francisco–which, if you ask us, is hands-down the best way to eat a burrito. As you might imagine, the burrito emoji is mostly used in posts about food. Mostly.","Did you know the word “burrito” translates to “little donkey?” It may be because a burrito faintly resembles bed rolls that donkeys sometimes carry. Though the burrito first appeared in Mexico, by most accounts, sometime in the mid-1800s, the Mesoamerican peoples of Mexico used corn tortillas in 10,000 B.C. to wrap food. In Mexico, the tortillas generally convey bean and meat, and little else, but in the U.S., you might find lettuce, diced tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, rice, cheese and a number of other items, just to ensure your post-burrito-eating experience makes you feel as full and uncomfortable as possible. In a good way. The burrito emoji kept food good company when it was approved as part of Unicode 8.0 in 2015: it made its debut with the taco, hot dog, popcorn and cheese wedge. The burrito was added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🦚 Peacock emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/peacock-emoji/,"The peacock emoji is an image of a blue and green peacock, with its tail feathers fanned into a half circle, and in most platforms, the body of the bird is front and center, colored in a rich, sapphire blue. It’s usually used in posts related to beauty.","The term peacock is used for the male, while the female is known as a peahen. For real! And, yup, it’s the males that display the bling in their iridescent tail, with shimmering jewel tones of blues, greens, and golds. In India and other southeast Asian cultures, the bird is symbolic of power, royalty, vanity, and pride. The ancient Greeks used the peacock as a symbol for immortality, and eventually the Christians adopted it, with the eyes in the tail representing the all-seeing eye of God. The bird eventually came to be associated with Paradise and the Tree of Life, and, essentially, immortality once again. The golden peacock symbolizes joy and creativity for Ashkenazi Jews. Talk about a hard working bird! The peacock emoji shared the limelight with a crazy mix of new emoji when it was approved as part of Unicode 11.0 in 2018. It debuted alongside soap, sponge softball, cupcake, mooncake, lobster, kangaroo, and swan emoji, to name a few. Oh, and the test tube. Peacock was added to Emoji 11.0 in 2018 as well."
💭 Thought Balloon emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/thought-balloon-emoji/,"Something on your mind? There’s an emoji for that.  The thought balloon emoji means you are thinking through something, as in trying to make a decision or come up with what to say next.  It also could mean you have a lot on your mind or are lost in your thoughts. Randomly, it is also sometimes used to represent a cloud in the sky. OK then.","The origin of the thought ballon is ancient. However the designer of the thought balloon emoji probably had something a little more contemporary in mind. Thought bubbles are seen throughout modern comic strips to indicate to a reader they are reading a character’s unvoiced thoughts, like in Charles M. Schultz’ classic Snoopy, which debuted in 1950.   The thought balloon emoji was added to the Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and Emoji 1.0 in 2015. It shows a line of little puffy clouds leading up on a big puffy cloud. On most devices and platform it’s white, except for Twitter, where it is blue. Apple’s use of three-dimensional shading makes it looks a little like a storm cloud."
🍍 Pineapple emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/pineapple-emoji/,"This exotic fruit is depicted with a bright green leafy top and its scale-laden body is in yellows and golden browns. It’s used in relation to fruit and food, to travel and hospitality, and, in certain circles, to one’s relationship status. 🤷‍♂️","And you thought a pineapple was just a pineapple! Well, sometimes it is. But, did you know that the pineapple is a symbol of hospitality, prosperity, friendship, and diplomacy too? The strange looking fruit was once popular as an architectural feature on buildings and in sculptures and its connection to travel, hospitality, and luxury is probably related to Christopher Columbus. The Italian explorer brought pineapples back from the New World, and in the 15th century, nothing said, “I have traveled far and wide” more than a pineapple … Today, the pineapple—like the lemon—is enjoyed in print design on clothing, textiles, and home decor items. It still exudes a kind of regal … deliciousness. In recent years, the pineapple emoji has been adopted on Snapchat to mean a “complicated” relationship status. Uh oh … spiky on the outside, sweet on the inside, we guess? The pineapple emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🦞 Lobster emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/lobster-emoji/,"Pass the butter! The lobster emoji, mmmmm (oops, sorry for the drooling), is finally crawling around the internet, replacing the crab emoji that was used in a pinch before 2018. Yes, of course the world needed a lobster emoji! Crab is not lobster, lobster is not crab. They’re not even related. The lobster emoji depicts the tasty marine crustacean in bright red, with its two large claws, ten legs, and delicious tail. It’s used mostly in posts related to lobster and seafood, though it has recently taken on another meaning in the transgender community.","The lobster emoji had to claw its way into a Unicode suite. After much outrage about the necessity of using the crab emoji in its place and a lobbying effort that included a pitch by Maine US Senator Angus King, the lobster finally made its debut in early 2018. It was met with howls of protest: it only had eight appendages, or legs, instead of ten. Shame. “Does it really matter? Does the poop emoji really look like poop?” naysayers wrote. Well, we are happy to report that that the Unicode Consortium corrected the mistake, and the lobster emoji, released as part of Unicode 11.0 in 2018 and added to Emoji 11.0 in 2018, is now a more accurate representation of the bug (that’s a lobster nickname, if you didn’t know) on all platforms. Twitter’s version has a whiff of whimsy about it, but there is no doubting it’s a lobster. Interestingly, the emoji has also been adopted by the transgender community, which has been lobbying Unicode for an emoji in the way of a blue and pink transgender flag for over two years. They were very disappointed when Unicode 11.0 was released and they saw that their efforts were unrewarded. Double shame. Why the lobster, you ask? The lobster is a gynandromorph, an organism that contains both male and female characteristics."
🔑 Key emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/key-emoji/,"Not to be confused with the old key emoji … the key emoji depicts a single key, and it’s presented in varying shades of brass and silver on various platforms. Most versions are modern keys, but a few of them, like Facebook’s version, use a pass key style, also known as a skeleton key, because it just has that old fashioned look. Oh, you fancy Facebook …","The idea of a key being an answer, or a way to unlock something that leads to an answer, has long been part of our language. “The key to happiness.” “The key to success.” “The key to the heart.” We’ve all heard these before … A key does literally unlock something: a door, a treasure chest, a diary. There are even digital keys, composed of numbers rather than metal, used in the digital world for security measures. So, using the word key in a metaphorical way relating to an answer or solution makes a lot of sense. (Yes, we’re teaching you about metaphors right now … chill out.) The key emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🌴 Palm Tree emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/palm-tree-emoji/,"Do you hear ukuleles? The palm tree emoji depicts a brown trunk with bright green palm fronds, and it immediately conjures images of vacation, the tropics, and relaxation. Are we there yet?  ","Bliss, paradise, vacation, relaxation…these are aspects of the tropical mental attitude that the palm tree emoji has come to represent. Then again, if you live in Hawaii, the emoji may make you think of your work commute, or maybe that tree out front that needs tending. It’s all perspective, right? The palm tree emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🍉 Watermelon emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/watermelon-emoji/,"The watermelon emoji depicts a large slice of watermelon, with luscious red flesh dotted with black seeds, cradled by a green rind. Yum. It’s mostly used in posts about food, sweetness, or affection … and also has some sexual connotations as well because what emoji doesn’t?","By some accounts, watermelon in dreams symbolizes intellect, love, work and desire, or lust. It can also imply sexuality in a larger sense, and fertility. OK then … go dream about some watermelons. In the medical world, watermelon is thought to contain an amino acid that could help stimulate blood flow, which makes it a possible boost for men with erectile dysfunction. We can think of worse ways to get in the mood than biting into a juicy piece of watermelon! Watermelon, and melon in general, is used in a vulgar way when referencing a woman’s breasts. And not just by fourteen-year-old boys … right? This is all proves why the watermelon emoji enjoys a double life: it works part-time representing summer’s favorite fruit and part-time in texting and social media to refer to sexual activity or a crude appreciation for a woman’s curves. The watermelon emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🥒 Cucumber emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/cucumber-emoji/,"The totally tubular cucumber emoji depicts the green fruit (yes, fruit!) with a simple illustration, usually showing a whole cuke, although a few platforms present it sliced up, exposing the seeds inside. It’s used in relation to food and beauty products featuring cucumbers and also as a symbol for—wait for it—the penis. (Surprise, surprise.)","Since the dawn of emoji time, phallic objects and vegetables have been reliable stand-ins for male penises. (Don’t blame us, we’re only the messenger.) The virtues of the cucumber as they relate to food go back 3,000 years, when India, soon followed by Greece and Italy, began growing the cucumiform (shaped like a cucumber) fruit. Yes, it’s a fruit, not a vegetable, and it belongs to the gourd family, growing on vines like their cousins, squash and melons. The emperor Tiberius (14 AD to 37 AD) reportedly loved the fruit so much that he had the plant grown year round and demanded it on his table twice daily. They were probably smaller then, more like a gherkin, which is what the cucumber emoji is modeled after today. The cucumber emoji was approved as part of Unicode 9.0 in 2016 and added to Emoji 3.0 in 2016."
🍭 Lollipop emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/lollipop-emoji/,"The lollipop emoji depicts the sweet treat in a number of different colors on various platforms, but always with a classic, round, hard candy on a stick. In some versions it’s in peppermint swirls, in others the swirls are multi-colored or simply in shades of pink. It’s used in posts about food and sweets, or to convey the idea of sweetness or innocence, or sometimes in sexual messaging.","The classic lollipop is often a simple and straightforward way to imply sweetness, whether on the taste buds or in mood or tone. For people involved in making candy or baking desserts, the lollipop emoji fits the bill because it’s instantly recognizable, it’s colorful and eye catching, and it conveys childhood and nostalgia, memories and “sweetness” of all kinds. Another word for a lollipop is a sucker due to the way we enjoy the sugary treat. It may not be a surprise to know that the emoji is also sometimes used to convey a sexual message, perhaps evoking oral sex or other innuendos. The lollipop emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🥕 Carrot emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/carrot-emoji/,"The carrot emoji depicts a bright orange carrot with a green leafy top. It’s used in social media to convey ideas about food, gardening, and healthy lifestyles. In texting, it can sometimes take on a more sexual meaning, which means it might not be the best emoji to text to a new friend. Wait a day.","Aside from being the constant sidekick to a certain bunny … Bugs Bunny, carrots are a root vegetable thought to have originated in Persia. They were originally grown for their seeds and leaves, and some of their relatives—cilantro, coriander, fennel—are grown today for that reason. Carrots grow mostly underground, and the part we eat is called the taproot, the main root of an organism. Now you know facts about carrots. Awesome. Today, the carrot often represents healthy eating. Also, today, in the world of texting and sexting and digital media, almost any food item with a tubular or cylindrical shape also takes on a second meaning … we’re so clever. Receiving a text with a carrot, eggplant, and, perhaps, a donut from someone you just met? Bets are good the texter is more interested in something sexual rather than a carrot, eggplant, and donut salad. As for the carrot emoji, it was approved as part of Unicode 9.0 in 2016 and added to Emoji 3.0 in 2016."
🦋 Butterfly emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/butterfly-emoji/,"The butterfly emoji represents the butterfly, as well as the symbolism associated with it: positive transformations, hope during a dark time, and new beginnings. And because the phrase “butterflies in your stomach” can signify the nervous energy of new love, this emoji can also mean that you have a crush or are falling in love.","In 2016, the butterfly emoji was added by the Unicode Consortium, the organization that standardizes computer language, along with a host of other wild creatures like the fox, eagle, bat, duck, owl, and shrimp. On Google and Microsoft devices, as well as on Facebook, the butterfly emoji design is based on the Monarch butterfly and therefore has orange wings: In contrast, on Apple devices and Twitter, the emoji has blue wings in reference to the Morpho butterfly."
🖤 Black Heart emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/black-heart-emoji/,"For some, the black heart emoji is the perfect emoji for a rainy day when you are sitting inside, feeling angsty and misunderstood. It can mean you are feeling emo, have a dark twisted soul, morbid sense of humor, or just love sad stuff. However, and much more seriously, the emoji has become increasingly used to express support for the Black Lives Matter movement.","The black heart emoji was released by the Unicode Consortium in 2016 along with 72 new emoji including the drooling face and the face palm.  On Twitter, it is a basic heart shaded completely black, but Apple and Google present a gradient from grey to black. Facebook gives it a darker border, and Microsoft adds a little white glint."

The heavy dollar sign emoji means money, mula, guap, cash, or dollar dollar bills y’all."," Of course we all know the heavy dollar sign emoji comes from the symbol meaning dollars, $. That symbol originally came from the abbreviation used for Spanish pesos in financial documents drawn up by English speakers doing business with Spanish-Americans in the 1770s. The emoji version of the symbol was approved by the Unicode Consortium in 2010, along with a slate of other money-related emoji such as the bank note with the dollar sign, the bank note with the euro sign, and yen with bank note. Everyone is familiar with this S with a line drawn straight down its center, though the color varies across platforms. It’s green in Google and Microsoft and gold in Samsung, but there is no mistaking this is the sign for cash money."

Conversely, it is sometimes used as an insult when it signifies someone who is being childish or acting like a baby.","The baby emoji shows a bright yellow baby face staring at you with wide eyes from under a single curl of hair. Samsung and Microsoft where nice enough to give their versions of the baby emoji a pacifier, while on Twitter and Facebook a single tooth indicates this emoji is teething … be prepared for some wailing. This yellow version was added to the Unicode Consortium in 2010. Five years later, the people and smileys category was updated to reflect the world’s racial diversity. Now the baby emoji now comes in a range of skin tones."
👶 Baby emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/baby-emoji/,"The Spider emoji 🕷️ depicts a black, or rarely brown, spider with eight legs. The emoji is modeled after a house spider or the funnel-web spider, a creature native to Australia whose potent venom can reportedly kill a person in minutes. The Spider emoji 🕷️ symbolizes the fascinating and dangerous arachnid and is associated with spookiness, witches, Halloween, and Goth culture.","The Spider emoji 🕷️ was approved by the Unicode Consortium in 2014 along with its compatriots the spider web and scorpion. This Spider emoji 🕷️ varies across platforms from a realistic and terrifying depiction with dimensional shading and pointy legs on Apple to a googly-eyed dangling arachnid on Google. Twitter’s spider is more abstract but still has enough detail to show pinchers, and Facebook’s is a realistic, three-dimensional monster."
💃 Dancer emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/dancer/,"The dancer emoji is a sexy, confident woman used to tell folks that you are ready to party, are cool and carefree, or are a confident, fun loving lady.

On Google devices, she has dark hair while on Apple she is blonde … or at least that bright yellow emoji color. Twitter doesn’t give her facial features. Neither does Facebook, but they add a pink flower behind her ear and layered ruffles. Originally, this emoji was meant to be gender neutral and early incarnations showed a stick figure. However, when the dancer emoji was added by the Unicode Consortium in 2010, the emoji appeared as a gendered female. She received a male partner in 2015 when Unicode added a disco-dancing dude in a blue suit."
🍩 Doughnut emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/doughnut/,"The Doughnut emoji 🍩 depicts a doughnut, a commonly eaten baked good. It is commonly used to represent real and metaphorical doughnuts, breakfast, bakeries and baked foods, snacks, coffee breaks, The Simpsons, and negative stereotypes of police officers. You are especially likely to see the Doughnut emoji used on June 4, which is National Doughnut Day. Donut is a commonly used alternate spelling of the word doughnut, especially in the United States. So, Donut emoji 🍩 is a popular name variant of the Doughnut emoji 🍩.","The Doughnut emoji 🍩, also popularly called Donut emoji 🍩, was approved under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. On most major platforms, the emoji resembles a brown doughnut with chocolate icing and multicolored sprinkles. On WhatsApp, the doughnut instead has strawberry icing. Depending on the platform, the doughnut may appear realistic or may be stylized. Doughnuts are a popular food often eaten as a snack or during breakfast with coffee. For this reason, the Doughnut emoji 🍩 can represent doughnuts and other junk foods or baked goods. If it is used to refer to breakfast, and it is often accompanied by other breakfast-themed emoji such as the Hot Beverage emoji ☕ (to represent coffee) or the Bagel emoji 🥯.

It is also used to refer to popular food chains and brands that make doughnuts, such as Dunkin’ Donuts and Krispy Kreme. In popular culture, members of the police are often depicted eating doughnuts, which is portrayed as their favorite food. This is especially the case when the portrayal is in a humorous or negative context. Because of this stereotype, the Doughnut emoji 🍩 can be seen alongside criticism or other negative opinions of police officers. Doughnuts are also the favorite food of Homer Simpson, a main character of the popular cartoon show The Simpsons.

🕊️ Dove of Peace emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/dove-of-peace/,"The dove of peace emoji or dove emoji was originally designed to be a religious symbol that resonated with Christian and Jewish users as well as a symbol for peace. However, users have adopted this symbol for secular use to simply mean bird and to express a love for the beauty of nature.","The dove of peace emoji shows a white bird, mid-flight clutching a sprig of green in its yellow beak. While Google shows the bird as flat and cartoon-like, Apple adds more details to give it a three dimensional look. Microsoft surrounds their bird with a thick black border. That sprig of green is mean to be an olive branch. In the Old Testament of the Bible, a dove appears to Noah, a profit God saved from a global flood sent to cleanse the Earth of sin. Noah sends a dove out from his ark and the dove returns with an olive branch in its beak showing the flood waters have gone down. Christians regard the dove as a symbol of the Holy Spirit and God’s peace. This is the background for the emoji, which was approved by the Unicode Consortium in 2015 along with other spiritual emojis meant to provide a greater representation of the world’s religions. These included three different types of crosses and the Sanskrit meditation sound “OM.”"
👸 Princess emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/princess/,"Grab your tiara, ball gown, diamonds, and 👸, girl, because you are ROYALTY!

Across platforms, the princess emoji shows a close-up of a woman’s face with long hair and a tiara, that signature headwear associated with queens-in-waiting. Her hair color varies, and her crown is sometimes studded with jewels. A few vendors give her a hint of a gown, as we see in Google’s design in the screenshot from Emojipedia below.

☮️ Peace Symbol emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/peace-symbol/,"Give peace a chance with the peace symbol emoji, ☮, that symbolizes peace, love, harmony, and overall good vibes, man.","The peace symbol emoji was added to Unicode 1.1 in 1993. It looked much simpler back then, getting properly emojified as part of Unicode’s Emoji 1.0 set in 2015. Across most platforms, it appears as a white peace symbol on a purple background, though Facebook features a black peace symbol on no background. On emoji keyboards, it’s found among other religious and astrological symbols, like the Latin cross ✝️ or Scorpio ♏ emoji, set off as they usually are in purple. The symbol that the emoji depicts is a universally recognizable symbol for peace designed in 1958 by Gerald Holtom for the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. According to Holtom, the symbol depicts both the flag semaphore symbols for the letters N and D (for nuclear disarmament) in a circle and a human with hands at their sides in front of Earth. Since its creation, the peace symbol has seen extensive use as part of protests against nuclear proliferation as well as war and violence more generally. The hippie-inflected countercultural movement that arose in opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1960s, for example, extensively used the peace symbol for its protests. Its emoji incarnation continues the campaign for peace and love into the digital age."
🏹 Bow and Arrow emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/bow-and-arrow/,"Been struck by Cupid’s arrow? Or, feeling like robbing from the rich to give to the poor? Time to get out the bow and arrow emoji 🏹. Most literally, the bow and arrow emoji represents the sport of archery, so it’s often used in the metaphor “on target.” It can indicate someone is experiencing those tingles and sparkles of love. It’s also associated with the zodiac sign of Sagittarius, depicted as a mythic archer.","From ancient mammoth hunting to the legend of Robin Hood, archery has a long and rich history. This is why it was proposed to Unicode in 2015 with a number of other sports-related emoji to “fill in gaps in symbols related to popular sports—with special attention to sports featured in international competitions such as the Olympic games.” Unicode 8.0 approved the bow and arrow emoji just in advance of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer Olympics. The emoji—fairly uniform across platforms apart from some minor color differences—depicts an arrow strung in a bow and ready to fire. While the original intent of the bow and arrow emoji was to celebrate the sport of archery, it became a symbol of the mythic Cupid and therefore love. In Roman myths, the goddess of love, Venus, deployed her mischievous son Cupid, to strike powerless humans with his arrows and fall in love. These associations have continued into modern times—from popular music to, well, emoji."
🎎 Japanese Dolls emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/japanese-dolls/,"Some emoji can seem utterly obscure or random, but they often have important meanings in Japan, where emoji originated.

They are meant to represent the Emperor and Empress of Japan and used for the March 3rd celebration of Hinamatsuri, or Doll’s Day or Girl’s Day.","The Japanese dolls emoji depicts a seated male and a female figure in traditional Japanese costume dating from the Heian Period (794–1185). These dolls are a major feature of the Peach Festival (Momo no Sekku), which became the Japanese Dolls Festival or Girl’s Day (Hinamatsuri) and celebrated on March 3. The male doll is known as obina and the female doll as mebina, and together they are meant to depict a royal wedding ceremony between an emperor and empress or prince and princess. The tradition of displaying these dolls during the Peach Festival dates back to at least 1625, when imperial court ladies set up a place for the emperor’s daughter, Oki-ko, to play. It’s believed that initially the dolls were for playing with, but now they are mainly for display. Many girls in Japan receive a set of these often expensive dolls, some of which are passed down as heirlooms. These Japanese dolls were approved under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. As shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below, the Apple emoji for Japanese dolls is the most detailed. The male doll, seated on the left, is dressed in blue and the female doll emoji is dressed in red. Both dolls have traditional Imperial Japanese headdresses as well."

It’s also used for news that may be shocking or clinching (i.e., a bombshell or boom, there is it). Occasionally, it’s used for actual explosives.","The bomb emoji was approved under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. Across platforms, it displays as a cartoon-styled, black sphere with a lit fuse, as if ready to go off. After Apple changed its pistol emoji, 🔫, to a water gun in 2016, with other major vendors following suit, a meme arose of the bomb emoji joking that it was being replaced with a water balloon."
🖖 Vulcan Salute emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/vulcan-salute/,"Live long and prosper, friends! If you ever need to spread the love to your geekier friends, then flash a 🖖. The Vulcan salute emoji, 🖖, is perfect for showing your Star Trek cred or sci-fi pride more generally.","The Vulcan Salute emoji is officially called the raised hand with part between middle and ring fingers emoji. And, that’s exactly what the emoji shows across platforms. Its default hue is yellow, but skin-tone modifiers allow users to change color. It joined emoji keyboards under Unicode 7.0 in 2014. The emoji commonly goes by the Vulcan salute because the gesture was popularized by Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who used it as a greeting in the sci-fi franchise, Star Trek. Nimoy first used the gesture in the 1967 TV episode “Amok Time,” in which Spock comes into contact with other members of his Vulcan race. Nimoy wanted the Vulcans to have a way of greeting one another similar to human hand gestures. In an interview with New York Times, Nimoy said that his Vulcan salute was inspired by a gesture that he witnessed during a Jewish religious service when he was a boy. Jewish priests perform the actual religious gesture with both hands to form the Hebrew letter shin, ש. The greeting Live long and prosper! has also accompanied the Vulcan salute ever since its debut in “Amok Time,” also inspired by Jewish scripture, with Deuteronomy 5:33 being the most cited inspiration for the phrase.  The Vulcan salute went memetic almost immediately after Nimoy’s first usage of the gesture. According to Nimoy, mere weeks after “Amok Time” aired, people were already using the gesture to greet him everywhere he went. The gesture was first popular among Star Trek fans but the gesture’s similarity to the popular V-shaped peace hand gesture (✌️), both in finger placement and good-willed intent, helped it catch on outside that community. The Vulcan salute was popular long before the rise of social media, so it comes as no surprise that the emoji version took off right away after Unicode added it on June 16, 2014.  Prior to that day, users had to make due with typographical substitutes. "
🐈 Cat emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/cat/,"Here kitty, kitty, kitty. As opposed to the cat face emoji 🐱, the cat emoji, 🐈, shows the whole kitty and caboodle to signify our feline pets. It is variously used to express affection for our domestic cat companions.","The cat emoji curled up on emoji keyboards (just as we were settling down to work) under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. Across platforms, the emoji points left and is sometimes sitting. Its form and color vary by vendor. Apple’s design is regal and realistic, with red-orange stripes and a white underbelly. Most others feature a more cartoonish, orange-hued Mittens, as shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below. The cat emoji joins other digital felines, like the tiger 🐅 or lion face 🦁. Ever wonder about all those other cat smileys on the keyboard, like pouting cat face 😾? They harken back to the fact that emoji originated in Japan, where cats are considered symbols of good luck and fortune. People feel feelings about cats. People feel feelings about emoji. And, some people really feel feelings about the cat emoji. One person launched a Change.org petition to Google to change its cat emoji back (which they recently modified in 2017): Her beautiful smile was a shining light in these dark times we find ourselves in. I urge Google to reconsider this change because she is the one thing keeping this nation together today. Don’t take my beautiful cat child away."
⚾️ Baseball emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/baseball/,"🎶 Take me out to the ⚾ game! 🎶 Based on the design of the modern-day baseball, the baseball emoji is used for all things related to the sport from which it gets its name, from the stats to the stands.","The baseball emoji—approved under Unicode 5.2 in 2009 and joining Unicode’s Emoji 1.0 set in 2015—is modeled after the ball used by Major League Baseball (MLB). While the white leather and red stitching design have become iconic (and is how the emoji appears across platforms, as shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below), the baseball was once far less glamorous. During the mid-1800s, when baseball was still an amateur sport, there was no standard for crafting a baseball. Instead, it would come in all different shapes and sizes, often cobbled together from the rubber of old shoes. In some cases, people got really creative, using fish eyes as the interior core of the balls, proving that there truly is a use for anything …? Fast forward to the early 1900s, when baseball had gone professional under the formation of the MLB, and there were two standard balls in play. The first, used by the National League, used black with red stitching, and the second, used by the American League, used red and blue stitching. In 1934, MLB standardized the ball and settled on red stitching, due to its high visibility and the fact that red was a mutual color used by both leagues. While the US may be the birthplace of baseball, the sport has seen growth in popularity around the world. In fact, the country with the highest medal count in the World Baseball Classic, baseball’s version of the World Cup, is not the US as of 2018, but Japan—birthplace of emoji."
🎃 Jack-O&#8217;-Lantern emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/jack-o-lantern/,"Falling leaves, pumpkin spice lattes, decorative gourds, king-sized candy bars, scary movies—the Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃 represents all things autumn and Halloween. The Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃 depicts a carved pumpkin with the green stem and classic jagged smile. Sometimes the emoji is used with spooky things in general, regardless of the time of year, and can stand in for pumpkin as food or a term of endearment.","The Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃—also known as the Pumpkin emoji—first carved its way onto keyboards under Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and quickly became a staple of Halloween and autumn emoji-dom. Some versions of the emoji feature a black face, as if unlit, but platforms such as Apple or WhatsApp use a jack-o’-lantern that appears to be illuminated from the inside with a yellow glow. All feature a classic, jagged-mouth smile, hinting at a mischievous but merry night to come. As with Christmas songs at stores, the Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃 has been the subject of “holiday creep,” popping up on Twitter feeds earlier and earlier each year. One curmudgeon who complained September was too soon for the Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃 was hilariously spammed with the emoji. Like many of its emoji brethren, Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃 has been put to creative use. Artist Zoe Mendelson rendered the 1966 children’s classic It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown! into emoji, starring the Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃, in 2013. Music artist E.M.M.A even paid tribute to the Jack-O’-Lantern emoji 🎃 by calling a track on her 2017 12-inch single “Pumpkin Emoji,” as the emoji is commonly called. "
🐿️ Chipmunk emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/chipmunk/,"Chipmunks sleep 15 hours a day, are loners, and eat almost anything—making their emoji incarnation perfect for the digital age. The Chipmunk emoji 🐿️, though, is often used to represent another rodent, the squirrel, because the two look similar from a distance. It can also be used to signify small rodents in general, of course, but also the great outdoors, hunger, cuteness, or just being a lil bit nutty or squirrely.","The Chipmunk emoji 🐿️ joined Unicode 7.0 in 2014. It typically features a profile of the critter with brown-red fur and side markings. Sometimes, it’s clutching an acorn.  Due to no fault of its own, the chipmunk emoji gets caught up in a lot of backlash regarding the nonexistent squirrel emoji. Folks claim the chipmunk emoji looks like a squirrel, just with stripes. As a result, they will often substitute the chipmunk for a squirrel, purposely or accidentally. Some have had enough, though, and demand an eastern gray squirrel emoji. A Change.org petition in 2017 asked the Unicode Consortium to “Make America Gray Again.” "
🇨🇺 Flag for Cuba emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/flag-for-cuba/,"The face with tongue emoji means a few different things. It’s playful, cheeky, sassy, and can imply a joke, or a bit of lasciviousness. It’s also often used with cute dog posts, though there is a dog face emoji with its tongue sticking out in the same fashion …","The face with tongue emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.1 in 2012 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Its original name was Face with Stuck-Out Tongue.

😛 Face with Tongue emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/face-with-tongue/,"Whether you desperately desire a delicious meal, a nice pair of shoes, or that cutie sitting across from you in the coffee shop, you might look like the drooling face emoji: 🤤. This emoji is used to convey such lust and longing as well as naptime—a less sexy time to drool. People seen as stupid are sometimes mocked as slobbering and slack-jawed, so the emoji also sometimes gets used to call someone or something “idiotic.”","2016 was a big year for the drooling face emoji. That year, the emoji was approved under Unicode 9.0. Across platforms, saliva is pouring out of the emoji’s mouth as the rest of the face looks relaxed with contentment or gobsmacked with lusty longing. This represents the metaphor of drooling over something, like Homer Simpson hungering for a donut. The drooling face emoji is not be confused with the face savoring food emoji 😋, which shows a smiley slurping in satisfaction, though both it and the drooling face emoji do get used for yummy eats and tasty treats."
🤤 Drooling Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/drooling-face/,"Havana nights, pork sandwiches, Afro-Latin jazz, classic cars, 🇨🇺, and hand-rolled cigars.

On the triangle is a white, five-pointed star. Created by Cuban writer Miguel Teurbe Tolón and general Narciso López for Cuban exiles during the mid-19th century, the Cuban flag didn’t become Cuba’s national flag until the country gained independence from the United States in 1902. In spite of a change in government in 1959 when communist revolutionary Fidel Castro came to power on the island, the flag of Cuba continued as the national flag.

🤑 Money Mouth Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/money-mouth-face/,"Ka-ching! This emoji is all about the green: a typical round emoji face with dollar signs for eyes and a green bank note for a tongue. Social-media posts using the money mouth face emoji are usually celebrating or expressing some wishful thinking around money. It’s also used in posts about jobs and sometimes represents the idea of “The Good Life.” But, we all know money can be a source of frustration, too. Maybe a frowning money mouth face is in the works …","There are a number of emoji available to express ideas related to all things money in texting and social media. The classic money bag emoji is nice, and the straightforward bank note emoji gets the job done, too. Most of the emoji appeared around 2015, which seems like a long wait, considering how popular they are. And then, there’s the money mouth face emoji which was approved as part of Unicode 8.0 in 2015 as well and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. This emoji makes light of the money-factor, as the smiley face is literally spewing money from its mouth. We’re not really sure of the intent here … but we’re guessing people needed an emoji that showed a love of wealth or an extreme involvement in money."
🍎 Red Apple emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/red-apple/,"Ahh, the classic red apple, with a solitary green leaf and perky stem. This crisp piece of fruit can represent anything related to food (especially healthy eating), school days and education, or the fall season. Is it a Red Delicious? A Gala? Maybe a Honeycrisp?  Mmmm. We don’t know, but we’re hungry regardless.","The red apple emoji has been around for a while, first approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. It signifies so many things, but it is mostly used in posts relating to food and the fall season. In addition to being a symbol for that delightful change of season (apple picking time!), it also represents education and teachers, and is a nod to Manhattan, or New York City, which has the nickname “Big Apple.” That nickname was coined by a sports writer in the 1920s and then picked up and revived by marketing agencies in the 1970s for a promotional campaign … guess it worked. The origins of the apple as a signifier for things related to school go back to the 1700s, when families in countries like Denmark would pay their teachers with baskets of apples. American families continued the tradition, with an occasional apple-for-the-teacher token until the early- to mid-1900s. It’s especially fitting since the apple long represented wisdom, going back to Greek mythology. And, let’s not forget the role of the apple in the story of Adam and Eve; that first bite set a new course for man/womankind!"
🏩 Love Hotel emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/love-hotel/,"Oh, boy. This emoji has two distinctly different ideas behind it. The love hotel or heart hospital emoji depicts a building with both a pink heart and on some platforms the letter H emblazoned on the front. It is mostly used in reference to hospitals and health as well as to vacation resorts. Those uses are far from the reported original intent, which was to indicate a house of ill repute (i.e., a bad reputation).","When the love hotel or heart hospital emoji  was created and approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 , it apparently meant a hotel where rooms may be rented by the hour, for … love. By the time it was added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015, the use had shifted. Maybe it’s the letter H atop the building or the sweet pink heart over the entrance. It might be the fact that it actually looks a bit like the hospital emoji seen here 🏥, depending on your viewing platform. Whatever it is, this is one of the most misused emojis we’ve come across; instead of being used to refer to a “love hotel,” it often just references hospitals and health care. It’s also used to mean a romantic resort or vacation getaway. So … a hotel for prostitution? Not so much. That’s why the love hotel emoji now has a second name: the heart hospital emoji."
💌 Love Letter emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/love-letter/,"The love letter emoji is one of many that use a traditional heart to convey the idea of love. On all platforms, the emoji is depicted with a simple envelope line drawing, the flap sealed with a pink or red heart sticker. It’s used in all kinds of posts and messages about love and affection.","Is there anything more romantic than a declaration of love in written form? Sadly, love letters have fallen out of favor …. Critics of texting and social media claim that even the act of writing a friendly letter has become a thing of the past, and that people are not learning to express themselves the way they used to. Yes, you could write a love letter to someone by email, but chances are good it won’t have the same impact as a handwritten one, lovingly folded and put into an envelope, addressed by the besotted‘s writer’s hand. Finding a real love letter in one’s mailbox is a thing to be savored and remembered. Or … so we’ve heard. Nobody’s writing the dictionary these days. Who wrote the first love letter, you ask? Chances are good the first declaration of love took its form in a gift of a dead animal or perhaps a cave drawing. That’s more romantic than email, too, we guess. The love letter emoji though wasn’t first written until it was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🎓 Graduation Cap emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/graduation-cap/,"The graduation cap emoji is an image of a square, black board affixed to a skull cap with a tassel attached at the center, hanging to one side. It’s typically worn by those graduating from high school or college. The emoji, however, is used in social-media posts about graduation, teaching and school, and also about learning in general.","The classic graduation cap is also known as a “mortar board,” because of its resemblance to the usually flat pan a bricklayer uses for mortar … weird. The cap is usually worn with an academic gown, resulting in the phrase, “cap and gown.” The style of the graduation cap is thought to go back to the biretta, a cap worn by Roman Catholic clergy, which evolved to be worn by noblemen and military leaders in the medieval and Renaissance and ages. It was originally only worn by holders of master’s degrees, but eventually undergraduates and those earning bachelors’ degrees were allowed to wear it too. Now, you can find pint-sized graduate caps for young children. The graduation cap  emoji got it’s degree when it was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🍋 Lemon emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/lemon/,"This pretty yellow citrus fruit is represented here in its simplest form, a tilted, yellow oval with a green leaf or two attached to the stem. It has several meanings, referring both to the fruit and its byproducts, like lemonade, in a literal sense, and to other representations which range from difficulties in life to love for a certain pop star. 🐝🍋","Lemons are associated with many things, including food, health, beverages, the much beloved performer Beyoncé, fabric and decorative design, and of course, the occasional bump in the road (a lemon) with which the resourceful person might make lemonade. Since lemons are sour, the metaphor works to suggest that life is not all sweetness and ease, and when one has a difficult moment, one should make the best of it. Often attributed to self-improvement guru Dale Carnegie in the 1940s, the first to use lemons as a “bad thing,” according to Wikipedia, was one Christian anarchist writer named Elbert Hubbard, in a 1915 eulogy for a friend: “He picked up the lemons that Fate had sent him and started a lemonade-stand.” Then, 100 years later the lemon emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. And so the story goes."
🏟️ Stadium emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/stadium/,"The stadium emoji depicts a round (in most cases) structure, usually marked with flags or floodlights, that represents the type of building that plays host to large crowds for sporting events and rock concerts. On most platforms, a green field is seen in the center, which is where games like football, baseball, and soccer take place. Which is why the emoji is mostly used in sports-related social-media posts.","Rah! The stadium emoji was approved as part of Unicode 7.0 in 2014 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. The emoji is largely used in social-media posts related to sporting events and teams, which is fitting since that’s where the stadium’s roots lie. The first known structure to house large sporting events and crowds is the stadium in tiny Olympia, Greece, where the Olympic Games began in 776 BC. This stadium was dedicated to Zeus. Fun fact: Rome’s Circus Maximus, largely a chariot-racing venue, was the first and largest stadium in ancient Rome, and isn’t round in shape, but is instead long and oval. Go ahead and whip that knowledge out at the next football game."
👓 Glasses emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/glasses/,"Varying slightly from platform to platform, the glasses emoji portrays a pair of eyeglasses with a gray or black frame. Most are square or slightly rounded. The glasses emoji is used in posts about eyewear fashion, and about being nerdy, or just in reference to brain power.","The glasses emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 under the name “Eyeglasses” and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Unlike the nerd face emoji, which depicts a face with eyeglasses, this emoji is generally used to imply a cool fashion sensibility. Just clicking through some posts with this emoji is enough to make a person want to jump on the glasses fashion trend."
😏 Smirking Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/smirking-face/,Up late at night on Tinder? Time to break out the smirking face emoji to make sure your sexy innuendo lands. Adding this emoji to a text indicates you are flirting or sending a suggestive message. On social media it can also mean you are feeling smug and self-satisfied because you just did something baller.,"Apple snuck this little grinner into their 2008 iPhone 2.2, but limited it to their Japanese market. The rest of us were able to start smirking to our friends and loved ones in 2010 when it was approved by the Unicode Consortium. It made its onto Twitter a year later. Snapchat included it in their 2015 update as a Friends Emojis, a system to help you manage your contacts by adding emoji next to each person to indicate how you feel about them. Across platforms this emoji’s round yellow face has an impishly curved smile and looks slyly to the left. On the Google and Microsoft versions the curves are softer, giving it a shyer appearance. Most have raised eyebrows, which Facebook and LG leave off. Only Mozilla’s version looks straight attcha."
😤 Face with Steam from Nose emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/face-with-steam-from-nose/,"This face with steam from nose emoji depicts an angry or highly annoyed face, eyes closed, brows scrunched up, and steam coming from the nostrils. It’s used to express a variety of emotions, ranging from frustration to pumped-up passion about a particular topic.","The face with steam from nose emoji was first approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 under the name Face With Look of Triumph and was intended to reflect a feeling of victory or pride. Hmmm. That was later downgraded to “disdainful,” but clearly this emoji depicts emotions like anger, frustration, determination, and pride, more than disdain. Though, instead of steam coming out of the little guy’s head, which is generally how we express this kind of discontent (in the world of cartoons and illustrations anyway), it’s raging out of his nostrils, which is sort of weird. It was added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
🗿 Moai emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/moai/,"The moai emoji depicts a head with elongated ears, nose, and a heavy brow, appearing to be carved out of gray stone. Use of the moai emoji is usually meant to imply strength or determination, and it’s also used frequently in Japanese pop-culture posts.","What the $&** is a moai? Well … moai is a type of rock carving found on Easter Island in Polynesia, dating back to the year 1250. They are monolithic creations, with the faces of deified ancestors; the oversized heads are the largest feature of the figures. The origin of this emoji is a bit clouded, as some claim it was suggested by Japan in reference to a statue referred to as Moyai at the Shibuya Station in Tokyo, Japan, something of a landmark. Moyai looks a bit like the Easter Island moai statuary, with the long broad nose and pronounced brow. But, the similarity ends there. The Moyai statue, a gift in the 1980s to the district from Japan’s volcanic Nii-jima Island, has very full lips (moai are thin) and the carving implies a mane of hair, which is not a feature of the maoi carvings. Nii-jima is home to numerous volcanic rock carvings of large faces and heads, called Moyai, which means ‘to work together in effort’ in the local dialect. They are like the younger cousins of Polynesia’s ancient carvings. The emoji, in our opinion, more closely resembles the Eastern Island relics. But some feel Japan sought the Moyai emoji as an accompaniment to other emoji, such as the Japanese flag and the Tokyo Tower. Others think the Polynesian relics are so distinctive and historic, that they deserved the emoji treatment. That said, the emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 under the name “Moyai,” not “moai,” and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015.  It’s unclear when the spelling changed to “moai.” Most platforms’ version of this emoji present a reasonable representation of actual moai, also spelled mo‘ai because we had to add another name just to confuse you … although most of the ancient carvings of the actual statues include bodies as well."
✋ Raised Hand emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/raised-hand/,"Bring it up high ✋ for this definition. The raised hand emoji, ✋, can be used to express “stop,” signal a high five, or imitate speaking up, as if raising one’s hand in class.","Raised hand emoji was released under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. The emoji appears as a single raised hand, with fingers together and the thumb pointing out to the side. It’s similar to the sign a crossing guard might make to indicate a driver or walker should stop. While its default color is yellow, skin-tone modifiers are available for raised hand emoji. The raised hand emoji has a range of tone. It can be negative. For example, it can convey “Stop bothering me” or “Don’t do that anymore” (e.g., talk to the hand).  It can also be more positive, expressing the fervor, say, of raising your hands in religious worship. "
🙁 Slightly Frowning Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/slightly-frowning-face/,The meanings of the slightly frowning face emoji run from “this is sad but not that sad” to “this is a tragedy of global proportions.” It can also signify that you think someone’s joke isn’t funny or that something might seem like a joke … but isn’t.,"Not be confused with the disappointed face emoji (with down-turned eyes and a deep frown), the slightly frowning face has a gentler frown and neutral eyes. Added to the Unicode Consortium in 2014, it is relatively consistent across platforms. However, on Facebook it has eyebrows, and Microsoft gave it their characteristic strong black border."
🎒 Backpack emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/backpack-emoji/,"The school bag emoji or backpack emoji depicts a small backpack, one more suitable for school kids than for adult backpackers. The emoji varies in color and style from platform to platform and is used in posts related to school and school sports, to bag fashion, and to street culture.","The backpack emoji is part of a group that includes coin purses, handbags, luggage, and briefcases. On various platforms, this emoji appears in a range of colors and styles, with LG’s looking like a rectangular, red box and WhatsApp’s being a more realistic version, an orange bag with straps and zipper compartments. Some claim there is a need for more adult versions, both a hiker’s backpack and a more “street” kind of backpack, which is used widely by young people everywhere. This emoji was first approved under the name “school satchel” as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015."
👜 Handbag emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/handbag/,"The handbag emoji depicts a rectangular handbag with short handles and comes in different colors on different platforms, including brown, purple, and pink. Its use relates mostly to shopping and fashion and is often used with other emoji, such as the lipstick and high heel emoji in posts related to femininity.","Not to be confused with an emoji that is named the purse emoji (which is actually a small coin purse), the handbag emoji typifies a medium-size bag with shorter handles, as opposed to an over-the-shoulder or across-the body type of bag. The handbag emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. There is also a clutch bag emoji, which indicates some real interest in the subject on the part of Unicode! Didn’t know there was a need for all three!

🌈 Rainbow emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/rainbow-emoji/,"The rainbow emoji 🌈 depicts a colorful arc of a rainbow. When not representing the meteorological phenomenon, the emoji can express various positive emotions, such as happiness, feelings of togetherness, hope, and good fortune. Along with the rainbow flag emoji 🏳️‍🌈, it’s commonly used to express LGBTQ identity and pride.","The rainbow emoji was added to Unicode 6.0 in 2016. Apple first implemented the emoji under iOS 2.2 in 2008 for iPhones in Japan, where the cell phone carriers SoftBank and au by KDDI had featured early versions of the emoji since 2000 and 2003, respectively.  Across major platforms, the rainbow emoji displays as an arc with most of the traditional colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Sorry, indigo. Facebook, however, does include an indigo band in its design, displayed in a blue sky. WhatsApp’s design has the rainbow emanating from a white cloud. With its diverse colors coming together into one, the rainbow has been a symbol of LGBTQ pride since 1978. That year, San Francisco politician and iconic gay rights activist Harvey Milk commissioned Gilbert Baker, a drag queen and US military veteran, to create a new flag to represent the LGBTQ community. In 2015, after the US Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, self-described “queer trans feminist nerd” Noah Slater requested the Unicode Consortium—the organization that approves new emojis—add a rainbow flag that “unambiguously symbolizes queer pride.” Unicode took action in 2016, making available a rainbow flag emoji as a sequence of the white flag emoji 🏳️ and rainbow emoji 🌈, yielding 🏳️‍🌈."
"🙈, 🙉, 🙊 Three Wise Monkey emoji",https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/three-wise-monkeys/,"The see–no-evil monkey emoji depicts the face of a monkey covered with the monkey’s hands. Most versions show the monkey’s mouth in a slight smile, which almost hints at a “hide or seek”  game, and it’s used in a wide variety of contexts such as, “Did I really say that?” to “I won’t tell a soul.” Similarly, the hear-no-evil monkey is used when people hear things they shouldn’t have or didn’t want to hear. And, we bet you can guess what the say-no-evil monkey emoji is used for … yup, when you just blurted out the wrong thing in the wrong situation. Nice job. But “see no evil” is part of the proverb, “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,” and is meant to carry a more significant message.","The ancient Japanese proverb “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” was popularized in the 17th century as a pictorial Shinto maxim, carved in the famous Tōshō-gū Shinto shrine in Nikkō, Japan. Three Wise Monkeys illustrated the idea of protecting one’s self from unsavory or challenging behavior, thought, or language. The saying embraces a Buddhist tenet of not dwelling on evil thoughts, though in Western cultures, the adage is colored with the idea of pretending to be ignorant or choosing to look the other way, and it implies some question of character. Monkeys are important in the Shinto religion, and the adage was represented with three monkeys in the carving: Wise monkey Mizaru, covers his eyes, and sees no evil; Kikazaru covers his ears, and hears no evil; and Iwazaru covers his mouth, and speaks no evil. Early Chinese Confucian philosophy certainly played a role in the birth of the adage, as a Confucian phrase from the third or fourth century B.C. reads, “Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.” Early Buddhist and Hindu versions of the idea varied, and in some illustrations there was a fourth monkey that referred to that last principle in the Confucian expression. The monkey, Shizaru, symbolized “do no evil,” and was shown either crossing his arms or covering his genitals. The Hindu interpretation of the fourth monkey was more along the lines of “don’t flaunt your happiness” than “don’t do evil things.” The see-no-evil Mizaru emoji— like its cohorts, Kikazaru and Iwazaru—was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. And, like its cohorts, the emoji is often used in lighthearted ways, and certainly not with the serious thought its creators intended. But, hey, that’s what happens when a couple of thousands of years pass. If the core concepts of the maxim remain, well, that’s pretty impressive, right?"
🐒 Monkey emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/monkey/,"Monkeys. They are mischievous, cute, and … cute. This monkey emoji reflects that, with a sweet countenance and curled tail, sitting as if perched on a tree branch. What is she up to? Sometimes we ask questions here, and we don’t always have the answers! But that doesn’t stop people from using the monkey emoji in social-media posts that range from animal-driven topics to comments on mischievous personal behavior.","The friendly monkey emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015, the same time that other animals like pig, chicken, rabbit face, and rooster were added. When the playful primate made its debut, chances are good that the idea was to release a whole menagerie of creatures into the emoji-sphere, because if you have one animal, you sort of need to have them all, don’t you? What’s a lizard without a snake to keep him company? A gorilla without a monkey?"
🦕 Sauropod emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/sauropod/,"The sauropod emoji depicts the general features of a Sauropoda, the largest known land animal which lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods … but in a slightly cartoonish way. Shown with a small head, short thick legs, long neck, and tail, the emoji exudes a kind benevolence, fitting for this herbivorous creature. The emoji can be used to express enthusiasm for dinosaurs, of course, as well as a critique of something or someone who is seen as old-fashioned or outdated.","Well, it’s about time! It may not have taken 66-million years (which is when dinosaurs vanished from the Earth), but a lot of people were long anticipating the arrival of this emoji. There were forums and web pages devoted to it, and even the Natural History Museum in London got on board with an internet-wide  “Sauropod Emoji Campaign.” People complained about too many chickens and a plethora of train emoji. “Why no dinosaurs?” they cried. The sauropod was finally approved as part of Unicode 10.0 in 2017 and added to Emoji 5.0 in 2017, which is when the T-rex emoji also appeared. Across platforms, the sauropod appears mostly blue or green and is full-bodied except for Facebook’s version, which features the head only. Sometimes you just have to wait for nice things."
🦆 Duck emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/duck/,"Ducks are cute, and this emoji also fits the bill 🤣. On most platforms, it’s seen as a mallard, in white, brown, and green.","What the duck? The duck emoji started out on the water, with a few hairs on his head blowing in the wind, but by the time it was approved as part of Unicode 9.0 and added to Emoji 3.0 in 2016, it had been simplified: the little duck body appeared on little duck legs, instead of bobbing in blue water. He’s a more dignified creature now, and there is certainly no rubber duck nonsense here. That, however, doesn’t stop people from using it when they’re referring to their significant other with a pet name like “ducky.”"
👿 Angry Face With Horns emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/angry-face-with-horns/,"Not exactly intimidating, the Angry Face With Horns emoji 👿 is a devilish creature, usually purple, with menacing eyebrows and two horns. Despite its appearance, this emoji is not typically used to convey true malevolence or threat. This character can be a bit mischievous; it can even be used to suggest a pouting mood, signaling a bit of toddler mayhem ahead. (Actually, that is terrifying!) The Angry Face With Horns emoji 👿 implies angry frustration or a reaction to an event, person, or news that is irritating, upsetting, or annoying.","The Angry Face With Horns emoji 👿 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 under the original name “Imp” and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. This emoji is part of the “monster” set of emoji, which includes a ghost, alien, skull, Japanese ogre, and goblin. Its counterpart is the Smiling Face With Horns emoji 😈. Interestingly, Facebook’s Angry Face With Horns emoji is the only one that shows its teeth. Yikes!"
⚓️ Anchor emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/anchor/,"The cigarette emoji, 🚬, shows a lit cigarette. It’s used for smoking cigarettes, cigars, and especially marijuana joints. It’s occasionally associated with relaxing, partying, bad boys, sexiness, and having an attitude.","Most of us are familiar with the no smoking sign and its emoji form, 🚭. It’s what the pilot turns on before a flight takes off if you haven’t air-travelled since 1988 and have forgotten you’re not allowed to smoke on a plane—and pretty much anywhere else. But where you can smoke, you might see the smoking symbol, as the cigarette emoji is officially called by Unicode. It was approved in 2010 under Unicode 6.0. Platforms depict it as a filtered cigarette with smoke lines and a red or ashy burning tip, as shown by the screenshot from Emojipedia below."
🚬 Cigarette emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/cigarette-emoji/,"Ahoy, mate! The anchor emoji uses a classic representation of an anchor, employing something called the “admiralty pattern,” the oldest, traditional version of a modern anchor. A ring sits at the top of a central shank, and at the other end two arms curve up with pointed flukes that dig into the seabed. A popular tattoo, the symbol represents things related to marine life, such as sailing, being in the navy, or working on a boat as a fisherman. It is also used in social media to reference stability and strength.","An anchor is a large, extremely heavy metal device, dropped with the use of chains over the side of boats to keep them in one place, or “anchored,” when they are in the water. The anchor emoji depicts just that and was approved as part of Unicode 4.1 in 2005 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. The origin of the anchor itself started with heavy rocks, logs, and even sacks of sand tied to a long rope. The anchor evolved with the Iron Age, which is a good thing since a sack of sand doesn’t make for a great tattoo."
🏮 Izakaya Lantern emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/red-paper-lantern-emoji/,"The man health worker emoji depicts a male who works in the medical field. It can be used to represent a doctor, therapist, surgeon, pharmacist, or any medical professional and is used when representation of the medical field is desired … with a male persona. There is also a female version of this emoji.","The man health care worker emoji was added to Emoji 4.0 in 2016 and is depicted across platforms in a white lab coat or colored scrubs with a stethoscope around his neck, as shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below. The male medical worker representation was followed shortly by its female counterpart in summer of 2016 when Google, a Unicode consortium member, proposed the creation of more female emojis in professional industries. The man health worker emoji is available in a range of skin tones, which were made available in 2015. "
👨‍⚕️ Man Health Worker emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/man-health-worker-emoji/,"‘Tis the season for the Christmas tree emoji 🎄. This emoji is an image of a traditional Christmas tree, one decorated with colorful ornaments and, in most cases, a star on top. It’s used mostly in early November as the holiday season gets underway, until just past the new year in mid- to late-January. While it might be jarring to see the Christmas tree emoji 🎄in May or August, many use it simply to reference the holiday season.","The Christmas Tree emoji 🎄 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to the Emoji 1.0 catalog in 2015. The traditional evergreen conifer is shown with colorful ornaments, although WhatsApp has a simpler tree with ornaments in a uniform red color. On most platforms, the topper is a star, which is the most popular tree-topper, representing the Star of Bethlehem, though angels are sometimes used as well, a reference to the archangel Gabriel. Christmas trees date back to medieval Latvia and Estonia, with the tradition becoming popular in the 1500s in Germany, where live trees were brought into homes and wooden pyramids were also constructed and decorated with apples, paper, evergreen boughs, and candles. Many believe the 16th-century Protestant reformer Martin Luther to be responsible for the tradition of adding lit candles, reportedly inspired by the twinkling stars above a treeline as he walked home one night. Largely thought to be a pagan tradition in the New World, Christmas trees didn’t really catch on with Americans until the early 1800s."
🎄 Christmas Tree emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/christmas-tree-emoji/,"The Latin cross emoji depicts what is also known as the Christian cross, the most common symbol of Christian iconography. The Latin, or Christian cross, has an elongated vertical arm and a shorter horizontal arm. It’s used when someone wants to make a Christian religious reference.","A Latin cross emoji was approved as part of Unicode 1.1 way back in 1993 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. It’s depicted on most platforms as a simple cross form on a purple or pink background, though some, like Samsung and Facebook, simply show the cross on a white background.  The cross is meant to evoke the crucifixion of Jesus. It’s used by people who are referencing their faith or their church and by people who are simply referencing Jesus or religion in many different contexts. It can also be used to indicate prayer or spirituality in a post or message. But, it’s not the only religious emoji … Unicode also includes other generic symbols, like the cross, that represent some of the world’s other religions, such as the Om symbol."
✝️ Latin cross emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/latin-cross-emoji/,"The izakaya lantern emoji, 🏮, is designed to look like a red paper lantern that’s typically hung outside an izakaya, a Japanese bar that usually also serves small, mostly fried or grilled dishes. Like a pub, but Japanese. The emoji is used to represent not only such pubs, but Japanese and East Asian culture more generally. ","The Japanese characters izakaya, 居酒屋, mean “to be/exist” (i/居), “alcohol” (zaka/酒), and “shop/seller” (ya/屋). A literal translation of the word could be something like “a shop that has alcohol” or “alcohol stand” (as in “fruit stand”). FYI, zaka/酒 can also be pronounced sake, and is the character for the specific drink, too.  In Japan, izakayas traditionally hang a red paper lantern out in front to mark themselves as bars for interested parties. (Think a Guinness sign outside an Irish pub.) They usually have words painted on them like 居酒屋 (izakaya), 酒 (sake/alcohol), or, you know, the name of the bar. These lanterns are known as akachochin (赤提灯), which literally translates as “red paper lantern.” Izakayas are so closely connected with the red paper lanterns, in fact, that one slang term for these bars is actually akachochin. These lanterns, and their bars, are what the softly lit 🏮 emoji is designed to resemble.  The Unicode Consortium released the izakaya lantern emoji in August 2010 as part of Unicode 6.0, which was the first version of the Unicode standard to support emoji. It’s officially called izakaya lantern emoji but commonly referred to as red paper lantern emoji."
🎆 Fireworks emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/fireworks-emoji/,"The Fireworks emoji 🎆 depicts a burst of color, displayed in the way that traditional fireworks fan out from a central point when they explode. It’s used in social media and texting to convey a celebratory mood or message and is most heavily used on New Year’s Eve and on the Fourth of July.","The Fireworks emoji 🎆 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. It comes in a range of colors and styles. This symbol is beloved and widely used, as it can express excitement, surprise, congratulations, and other high emotions. It’s also frequently used twice a year in the United States, on the Fourth of July, or Independence Day, and New Year’s Eve, on December 31. The first American Independence Day display occurred in Philadelphia (with a smaller display in Boston) on the country’s one year birthday, July 4, 1777. Statesman John Adams, who helped draft the Declaration of Independence, wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, that there should be a “great anniversary Festival,” one “solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.” And, so it was! Did you know that fireworks go back to China’s Tang Dynasty in the ninth century? They believed fireworks could dispel bad luck and evil spirits and bring about just the opposite. So, it makes sense to begin each new year with a colorful display of things exploding in the sky, right? All done within reason (and with caution), of course!"
🐖 Pig emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/pig-emoji/,"The pig emoji depicts a … pig … in a variety of styles, most of them cartoonish and cute. This emoji symbolize many things on social media, including rural living, cuteness in the animal world, money and banks (yes, like piggy banks), greed and gluttony (have you ever seen a hungry pig at the trough?), and barnyard animals.","The pig emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. On most platforms, the animal is depicted as being rather cute and cuddly, which makes the bacon part of the equation rather unpleasant. Pigs are highly intelligent animals and have long been associated in various cultures with economic prosperity, good luck, lust, fertility, and laziness. But … you won’t see them used in social media much in any of those representations. The pig is the 12th animal in the Chinese Zodiac, and those born under the sign of the pig are generally trusting, goal-oriented, calm, compassionate, and generous. And so, people will use the pig emoji to represent these parts of their personality if they were born under this sign or if it’s the year of the pig. And … because we’re a dictionary … here’s your word of the day: ungulate. That’s a hooved animal. You’re welcome."
😨 Fearful Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/fearful-face-emoji/,"The fearful face emoji expresses a blend of surprise and fear, in equal parts. It’s used in response to a revelation, some not-so-great news, or to something (or someone) that just might cause unhappiness or a challenge.","Eyes wide open, raised eyebrows, mouth agape or in a classic frown: the fearful face emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Sometimes referred to as the worried face emoji, it is also used to express concern and angst. It’s not exactly “The Scream,” so no need to panic: there is a glimmer of hope, a possible way out. The blue shading at the top is used to represent a pale face … as in so shocked you lost your color. Maybe it’s the teeth, but the HTC version of this emoji is particularly unsettling in our opinion, as this chart from Emojipedia shows. "
😴 Sleeping Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/sleeping-face-emoji/,"The sleeping face emoji depicts a calm face, snoozing away without a care in the world. Used in all kinds of posts that revolve around sleep and boredom, it’s also referred to as the snoring face and sleep face emoji.","You’re feeling sleepy … very sleepy. The sleeping face emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.1 in 2012 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. On all platforms, the traditional “zzz” is used to represent a peaceful, content snore, a vision that might annoy the insomniacs amongst us. Why “zzz,” you might ask? Well, it’s one of those onomatopoeic words, where the “z” sound replicates—to some degree—the sound of a snore. We think the Mozilla platform version looks like an infant as the screenshot from Emojipedia shows below. Awwww. "
😢 Crying Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/crying-face-emoji/,"Feeling down and out? You’ll likely reach for the crying face emoji, which features a single tear rolling down a sad, mildly agonized face. This emoji is used not only to express one’s own emotional state, but to empathize with others.","The crying face emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. While most versions imply some mild trauma or despair, the LG version evokes a bit of “I’ll brave through this thing,” due perhaps to the lack of eyebrows, which makes the simple face appear more stoic."
✌️ Victory Hand emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/victory-hand/,"The victory hand emoji, ✌️, is a representation of the peace sign. It can be used to express goodwill and “goodbye.” More crudely, it can tell someone off, like a middle finger, or, more sexily, it can represent female masturbation. When wrapped around text, it can simulate air quotes.","The victory hand, or V sign, has its origins in the WWII resistance to the Nazis. The Belgian BBC broadcaster Victor de Laveleye suggested in January 1941 that the victory sign—made with index and middle finger spread and facing out, the remaining fingers held down with the thumb—become a symbol of unity and victory for the Allied forces, as the word for victory in French (victoire) and for freedom in Dutch (vrijheid) both started with letter V. The symbol took off, first in Belgium, the Netherlands, and England, and later throughout occupied Europe. Later, it came to be a general symbol for peace when it was adopted by Vietnam War protesters in the 1970s and has since become commonly called the peace sign gesture and recognized around the world. The victory hand emoji is a digital representation of the victory hand. In 1993, the victory hand was added to Unicode 1.1, making it an old-school icon. In 2015, it was added to Unicode’s Emoji 1.0 set. The victory hand comes in a default yellow but skin-tone modifiers allow users to change its color."
🏍️ Motorcycle emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/motorcycle/,"Are you ready to ride? The motorcycle emoji, 🏍️, depicts a motorcycle, a motorized bicycle popular for racing, transportation, and off-road adventures.","While the motorcycle came to be in the late 1800s, it wasn’t until 2014 that the motorcycle emoji hit the digital road as part of Unicode 7.0. The appearance of the motorcycle emoji, officially called Racing Motorcycle by Unicode, varies across different platforms, as shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below. It may also popularly go by motorbike emoji. Some platforms, such as Microsoft, feature a person on the bike, while most, including Apple and Google, feature a driver-less vehicle. Color ranges widely, too, but major vendors show the front of the bike facing left. They also depict a vehicle that suggests a superbike used in motorcycle racing. Apple’s design, however, resembles a cruiser motorcycle. The motorcycle emoji is not to be confused with the motor scooter emoji, 🛵."
😞 Disappointed Face emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/disappointed-face/,"It’s a bit of a bummer, but the disappointed face emoji, 😞, expresses varying degrees of sadness and disappointment. People use it for everything from when a beloved friend passes away to when they couldn’t get tickets to the Beyoncé concert 😞.","The disappointed face was added to Unicode 6.0 in 2010. On most platforms, it appears as a yellow face frowning with closed eyes and eyebrows furrowed in sadness. It may be confused with the pensive face emoji, 😔, which is very similar but has more expressive eyebrows and a flatter mouth. It might also be mistaken for the slightly frowning face emoji, 🙁, which doesn’t have eyebrows and seems to be saying Eep! On some platforms, when you type in :(, it will auto-supply the disappointed face emoji. That makes it one of the most commonly used emoji, essentially used as a go-to sad face, as the emoji is indeed sometimes called. The disappointed face emoji is used to add tone and subtext to messages on social media or texts that could otherwise come off as flat or harsh. For example, “there’s nothing I can do 😞” feels much more helpless with the disappointed face emoji. "
👪 Family emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/family-emoji/,"We’re all one big happy 👪 … The family emoji, 👪, depicts a family unit. Given the great diversity in family makeup, variations of the family emoji represent everything from single-parent and same-sex-parent families to families of different ethnic backgrounds to families with multiple children. While the family emoji is often used literally, it’s also sometimes used as a metaphor to represent the idea of unity and togetherness.","The family emoji, approved under Unicode 6.0 in 2010, is meant to represent a family unit. The default family emoji depicts a father, mother, and son, all in the supposedly racially neutral color of bright yellow. However, in 2014, after thousands of social-media users and even celebrities like Miley Cyrus signed a petition calling for greater representation in emoji, Unicode added skin tone modifiers in 2015. Since then, also based on popular demand, Unicode has made available a great number of family sequences to represent more diversity in family types (e.g., a mother and daughter, two fathers and two sons, a father with a daughter and a son) all in various skin tones.  While major vendors like Apple or Android haven’t implemented interracial emojis (though technically available), it was among the top 30 requested emoji of 2016 according to Emojipedia. Microsoft, however, noted the clamor. Its 2016 Windows 10 Anniversary Update came with a simple fix to make sure everyone felt represented: 52,000 different possible family emoji, though they have to be copy-and-pasted in as opposed to accessed directly in a native emoji set. It’s this sheer number that has so far deterred the likes of Apple, as they haven’t figured out how to fit them all on their emoji keyboard."
🍱 Bento Box emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/bento-box-emoji/,"The bento box emoji, 🍱, represents a traditional Japanese boxed lunch, called a bento box, or a meal at a Japanese restaurant in the same style.  It’s used for such lunches and meals, as well as for Japanese and Asian cuisine more generally, and Western small-plate dishes and snacks. ","In Japanese, bento (弁当, among other forms) literally just means “lunch box” or “packed lunch,” traced back to a medieval Chinese term for “convenient.” How handy.  Bento refers to both the lunch container and the lunch itself, but the container is more commonly referred to as a bento box. Originally made of bamboo, contemporary bento boxes are made of wood, plastic, metal, and other materials. A traditional Japanese lunch consists of rice, plus small dishes of veggies and fish or meat, and bento boxes are often sectioned off in serving them—as the bento box emoji so depicts, like in this screenshot from Emojipedia below. Bentos started out as homemade lunches to take to work or school. Over time, they also began appearing in train stations and convenience stores as grab-and-go food options for commuters and traveling workers. Some Japanese restaurants, especially sushi restaurants in the West, also offer set bento box meals in lacquered, sectioned trays.  The bento box emoji was approved in 2010 under Unicode 6.0 and joins a number of other Japan-specific emoji known to confuse Westerners who forget that emoji originate in Japan (such as the Japanese dolls 🎎, sake bottle and cup 🍶, and goblin 👺). As you may have noticed, most versions of the bento box emoji across platforms look more like a restaurant set meal tray than a lunch box. This is likely a consequence of Western designers (and emoji users) being more familiar with the restaurant type of bento box. "

One special use of the shooting star emoji is in reference The More You Know, a public service announcement series from NBC, popular in the 1990s and featuring a shooting star icon. People post “the more you know” and 🌠 online when delivering some feel-good life-lesson or ironic observation.","It was 2010 when the shooting star emoji was approved under Unicode 6.0. On many platforms, including Apple, the shooting star emoji appears as a star in a blue box, representing the night sky. On other platforms, such as Google, the star stands alone. On all platforms, though, the yellow-gold star moves from the upper-righthand direction to the lower-lefthand corner, as indicated by the trail in its wake and shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below.  The shooting star emoji is located in different categories on different platforms. On Apple devices, this emoji sits beside the fireworks emoji 🎆 and the sparkler emoji 🎇 in the Travel & Places section. Android users will find it next to the white medium star emoji ⭐ and the glowing star emoji 🌟 in the Animals & Nature section.

👽 Alien emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/alien-emoji/,"The grinning face with smiling eyes emoji expresses joy, happiness, cheerfulness, or excitement. It might also be used to show an ironic attempt at positivity when things are grim.","Grinning face with smiling eyes emoji was included as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. In September 2016, Apple released an update to iOS that changed the emoji’s look, making it much more clear that it depicted a happy face. Before then, on iOS this emoji looked very similar to the already existing grimacing face emoji. Other platforms like Facebook and Twitter had this same design issue. This caused the emoji to previously be perceived as a grimace or as something negative due to the design. Because of this, many users have come to think of this emoji as representing awkwardness, discomfort, or displeasure despite its positive name.  This cross-platform graphical difference resulted in ambiguity and some unintended meanings. A person might think they were sending out a happy face, but the recipient might receive a grimace instead. Grimaces are quite far from the feelings that someone who meant to send a grin might want to communicate. In fact, in a study done by Hannah Miller, a researcher at the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota, a person receiving the grinning face with smiling eyes emoji on an Apple device generally perceived it as having a negative sentiment overall. But, the grinning face with smiling eyes emoji is generally very positive in meaning. Today, this emoji is more graphically consistent across platforms than it was in the past, and so its meaning is no longer ambiguous or confused between devices. Since it’s been standardized, on all devices it now has a big grin that radiates genuine joy and happiness.  "

One should now be mindful of context when using or coming across this emoji.","The OK hand emoji is also referred to as the A-OK, OK, or OK hand sign emoji. Like the word OK, the OK hand emoji can convey simple agreement, understanding, or satisfaction. If someone texts a friend asking if they want to meet up, the friend might reply with the OK hand emoji as if to say “OK,” “Sure,” or “Sounds good.” In these contexts, the OK hand emoji can stand in for the word OK or related terms. The OK hand emoji, however, is often used to express that something is perfect, excellent, just right, choice, or on point.  The emoji can also mark sarcasm, like an ironic “Good job” or “Way to go.” For instance: “Just spent all night writing a term paper. Forget to hit save. .” As with other emoji, strings of OK hands can intensify or emphasize the sentiment. Beginning in 2017, the “OK” hand gesture began to be interpreted as a white supremacist hand signal due to a hoax spread by alt-right communities and users of the web site 4chan that the symbol was actually a secret white supremacist gesture. At first used to troll the media, the gesture eventually lost its satiric intent and was used sincerely by white supremacists to promote racist views. The hijacking of the gesture was so widespread that the Anti-Defamation League added it as a hate symbol in 2019.  "

In March 2014, Alexander Abad-Santos and Allie Jones wrote in The Atlantic that the nail polish emoji was “the Beyonce of emojis,” and can mean “anything from shutting haters down to a sense of accomplishment; a swift ‘I don’t care’ to a spa day.” Adam Sternbergh observed in New York Magazine in November, 2014 that the nail polish emoji had begun to mean “I’m not bothered” or “Haters gonna hate.”  The sassy sense of the nail polish emoji had indeed become so popular that BuzzFeed declared 2014 “the year of the nail care emoji” in a year-end roundup of the “most nail care emoji moments” of the past year."
👯 People With Bunny Ears emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/people-with-bunny-ears-emoji/,"The people with bunny ears (partying) emoji is variously used across digital contexts to express a fun, party-loving spirit, communicate festive and friendly sentiments, and mark content dealing with adult entertainment.","According to Emojipedia, the people with bunny ears is based on Japanese bunny girls, a borrowing of the iconic US Playboy Bunnies. In Japan, the costume is popular in anime, manga, and fan art as well as, true to the original concept, adult entertainers. Many people in the US didn’t realize the emoji depicted bunny ears because the ears were short in early Apple designs, and commonly deemed them ballerinas with headbands. However, the 2015 8.3 iOS update increased the size of the bunny ears by 200%, making them more prominent. This change elicited negative reviews from users, some of whom called emoji sexist for including the bunny ears, among other reasons.

🍆 Eggplant emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/eggplant-emoji/,"The eggplant emoji is a long, purple eggplant, but it’s really just used to represent a penis.

According to “Among the New Words,” a quarterly article in the journal American Speech, the eggplant emoji was used on Twitter to mean “penis” as early as 2011. In March of 2014, the video artist Jesse Hill “translated” Beyoncé’s hit song “Drunk in Love” into emoji, using the eggplant to represent Jay Z’s penis.        Later that year, the emoji inspired a trend on Instagram and other social-media sites called “#EggplantFriday,” a hashtag that was linked to posts where men posted explicit images of their “eggplants.” But in 2015, Instagram actually blocked the eggplant emoji and references to it (e.g., “#eggplant”) from its search functionality. Instagram’s ban resulted in a campaign called “#FreetheEggplant,” modeled after the similar campaign “#FreetheNipple,” in 2012 for gender equality.          In 2016, the American Dialect Society named the eggplant emoji the “Most Notable Emoji” of 2015 due to its widespread use as sexual innuendo. The eggplant emoji has also inspired two companies, Eggplant in the Mail and the Eggplant Mail, which let customers send actual eggplants in the mail as gag gifts. And, the company Emojibrator released an eggplant emoji vibrator in 2016 … of course.   "

It is commonly used to praise someone or something, signifying that a person, object, album, movie, or so on, is “lit,” a slang term to describe something that is exceptionally cool or great. As lit is also slang for “intoxicated,” the fire emoji doubles as a way to say someone is very high or wasted. The term fire has been used as slang for high-quality weed in hip-hop since the early 1990s, and so sometimes the fire emoji is used to reference marijuana.

🐐 Goat emoji,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/goat-emoji/,"When not alluding to the literal animal, the goat emoji stands for GOAT, an acronym meaning Greatest of All Time. It is generally used in reference to highly skilled individuals, such as award-winning musicians or talented athletes, in order to praise them as being the all-time best in their chosen field. For example, in 2022 quarterback Tom Brady was praised as a GOAT upon his retirement after 22 seasons with the NFL.","The goat emoji is used to signify that someone is highly talented, arguably even the Greatest of All Time. This label is often applied to athletes, and especially to hip-hop stars.  While the acronym GOAT seems to have first appeared in the 1990s, it was not until rapper LL Cool J released his album G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time) in 2000 that the term achieved widespread recognition. The album was a huge success, and cemented the now seemingly random connection between worldwide success and the goat emoji. Upon his retirement in 2022, sports fans and media crowned quarterback Tom Brady the GOAT  for his accolades: Brady is a seven-time Super Bowl champion and has been named Super Bowl MVP five times, a feat unmatched by any other player. The title has been similarly used in sports to refer to Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and Simone Biles, for example. Not everyone is familiar with the term, however—in 2021, Meryl Streep humorously reported she thought Jonah Hill was comparing her to a farm animal when he called her the GOAT."
